    <p>ToDoList is software in the category of Task Management, Project Management, Productivity, “Getting Things Done” (GTD), Scheduling, and Collaboration. We have a lot of choices to help us keep track of daily obligations. A simple list on paper of things “To Do” is enough for some people</p>
    <p>Unlike lightweight, freebie or cutesy list tools, use Todo when you have a deadline, NEED to focus, prioritize and get things done quickly–from home or school projects, to dozens of work tasks–with sub-tasks and projects.</p>
    <p> At their most basic, to-dos contain all of the tasks that you need to complete on a given day. It's a great device for managing time that enables you to lay out everything that you need to accomplish and plan and prioritize your day from there.</p>
